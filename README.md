## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syahrulhuda/ChatBox.git
```

### 2. Firebase Setup

This project uses Firebase for authentication and database services. You need to set up a Firebase project to run the application.

#### a. Get `google-services.json`

The `google-services.json` file contains the configuration for the Firebase project. You can get this file from the **OTHING PROJECTS** WhatsApp group.

**Please download the `google-services.json` file from the group chat.**

#### b. Place `google-services.json`

After downloading the file, you need to place it in the `app` directory of the project.

If you are using a file explorer, navigate to the `ChatBox` folder you cloned, and then open the `app` folder. Place the `google-services.json` file there.

The exact path from the root of the project is: `ChatBox/app/google-services.json`

### 3. Build and Run the Project

Once you have placed the `google-services.json` file in the correct directory, you can open the project in Android Studio and run it on an emulator or a physical device.

1.  Open Android Studio.
2.  Click on **"Open"**.
3.  Navigate to the cloned `ChatBox` directory and select it.
4.  Let Android Studio sync the project.
5.  Click on the **"Run 'app'"** button (the green play icon) to build and run the application.
